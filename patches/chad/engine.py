"""
MLX inference engine for the chad backend.

The thing that makes this feel like Claude Code's backend is the **persistent prefix
KV cache**: each agentic turn re-renders the whole transcript but only prefills the
*new* tokens appended since last turn, so multi-step tool loops stay snappy instead of
re-reading the whole conversation every step. We keep the KV cache alive across turns
and extend it by diffing token ids (see `_sync_to` / `generate`).

Two decode-speed levers were investigated (see the README's throughput section):

1. **Prompt-lookup decoding (PLD)** — draft-model-free speculative decoding, gated on a
   *trimmable* cache (`engine._trimmable`) and temp==0. It is provably greedy-identical
   and helps trimmable models on quote-heavy work, but the shipped hybrid SSM/attention
   cache is non-trimmable, so PLD falls back cleanly and does not speed up the shipped
   model. (`prompt_lookup_draft` + `_generate_prompt_lookup`.)
2. **Thinking budget** — `--no-think` drops the model's `<think>` overhead; the most
   effective real speedup for time-to-done, since decode is bandwidth-bound (~47 tok/s).

chad is single-model by construction: there is no second "draft" model anywhere in the
engine. PLD gets speculative decoding's accept/rollback benefit from the context itself.

        Per step: look for a long (>= pld_wide_min_ngram) recurrence of the
        current suffix in the context; if found, copy up to pld_wide_draft
        continuation tokens as the draft and verify them in ONE batched
        forward — the batched matmul path is flat from S=12 to S=32, so a wide
        verify costs the same as a narrow one. If not found, take a plain S=1
        decode step. Acceptance is
        point-mass rejection sampling (accept draft token d w.p. p(d), resample
        the residual on rejection), which preserves the output distribution
        exactly — greedy included.

        Rollback on partial rejection is the capture-replay mechanism:
        the verify forward records each GDN layer's recurrence inputs, and a
        rejection replays the accepted prefix from the captured state — no
        re-feed forward, which is what made enable_pld_hybrid a loss."""

          holds on the quantized-from-the-start cache: trim moves the offset
          and the re-feed rewrites rows above it before they are ever read.
        - The drafter cache holds only COMMITTED positions: the drafter never
          caches its block at all, and its context cache is fed the verify
          forward's tapped hiddens of the committed tokens. RoPE is relative
          under attention, so the turn-local (zero-based) drafter context is
